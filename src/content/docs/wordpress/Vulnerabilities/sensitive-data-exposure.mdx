## Introduction

This article covers cases of possible sensitive data exposure on WordPress. This is a subset of Broken Access Control which impacts the confidentiality instead of integrity. This vulnerability occurs due to the lack of proper confidentiality check on the requested resource.

## Example Cases

Below is an example of vulnerable code:

```php
add_action("wp_ajax_nopriv_view_course", "view_course");

function view_course(){
    $course_id = urldecode( $_POST['course_id'] ?? '' );
    
    if ( empty( $course_id ) ) {
        wp_send_json_error( [ 'message' => 'Invalid Course ID' ] );
    }
    
    $course = get_post( $course_id );
    
    wp_send_json_success( [
        'id'      => $course->ID,
        'title'   => $course->post_title,
        'content' => $course->post_content,
        'excerpt' => $course->post_excerpt,
        'url'     => get_permalink( $course->ID ),
    ] );
};
```

To exploit this, any unauthenticated user just needs to perform a POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint specifying the post ID which is not in the published state to view any post information. This can lead to attacker viewing draft, password-protected and pending posts.

```bash
curl <WORDPRESS_BASE_URL>/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=view_course&course_id=1337
```
